> Reduce for async iterables.

The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each element
in the async iterable (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

## Async iterable fun

> **_This module is part of
> [Async iterable fun](https://github.com/parro-it/ai-fun), a complete toolset
> of modules to work with async iterables._**

## Usage

_Reduce to an async iterable to the sum of its elements:_

```js
import reduce from("ai-reduce");
const add = (accum, item) => accum + item;
console.log( await reduce([2, 3], add, 1) );
```

This will output 6

### index

The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each element
in the async iterable to reduce it to a single promise.

**Parameters**

* `data` **AsyncIterable** The async iterable to reduce
* `reducer`
  **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)**
  Function to execute on each element in the async iterable, taking four
  arguments:

```
      data - The async iterable reduce was called upon.

      accumulator - The accumulator accumulates the callback's return values; it is
      the accumulated value previously returned in the last invocation of the
      callback, or initialValue, if supplied (see below).

      currentValue - The current element being processed in the async iterable.

      currentIndex - The index of the current element being processed in the async
      iterable. Starts at index 0, if an initialValue is provided, and at index 1
      otherwise.
```

* `initialValue` **any** Value to use as the first argument to the first call of
  the callback. If no initial value is supplied, the first element in the async
  iterable will be used. Calling reduce on an empty async iterable without an
  initial value is an error.

Returns
**[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)**
The promise value that results from the reduction.

### with

Higher order function that partially apply `reducer` and `accumulator` arguments
to the reduce function.

**Parameters**

* `reducer`
  **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)**
  The reducer argument to partially apply
* `accumulator` **any** The accumulator argument to partially apply

Returns
**[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)**
A `reduce` unary function that take a data argument
